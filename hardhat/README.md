# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts

npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help

npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run --network polygonMumbai scripts/deploy.ts
npx hardhat --network polygonMumbai verify {YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}

```
